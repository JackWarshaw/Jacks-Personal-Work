<h3> Description : </h3>

ResuMaybe is a resume-building tabletop roleplaying game, where you play as either an Interviewer looking to fill a newly opened position, or an Applicant with a randomly filled resume and no knowledge of what the job might be. With only one position up for grabs, it's up to the Interviewer to ask questions that will help them find the right candidate for them, while the Applicants fight to figure out the job and tailor their answers to be awarded with a shiny new job for their resume. 

<h3>  </h3> 

<h3> Process : </h3> 

We began building ResuMaybe by ideating on its gameplay loop, building out several ways that we could create an interview experience with automatically generated resumes. Our biggest hurdle at this time was the Question phase. While our original idea was to have Interviewers randomly draw cards that would contain questions for the Applicants, we realized this would give players little information on the job they were interviewing for and would potentially not even be relevant to the Interviewer. Instead, we opted for several questions that were developed for each position, with some being shared between positions so more experienced players could not easily determine what the position was. However, the Applicant questions remained universal as to not further challenge the Applicants in determinding the open position. 

<h3> </h3>

Once we finalized the structure of our gameplay loop, we branched out into different disciplines. I, along with other narrative team members, wrote and edited the rules of the game, along with the various prompts, questions, and bios that would come up in play. Others manufactured the cards and playsheets, which were then used in player testing facilitated by yet more members. After rigorous testing, we fine tuned the mechanics and visuals of ResuMaybe, and launched it on itch.io .

The team intends to produce further updates to ResuMaybe, adding new jobs, experience, and questions over time.
