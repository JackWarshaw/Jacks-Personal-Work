<h3> Description : </h3>

Flocking Hell, awarded **Best Non-Digital Game** at the NYU Global Game Jam 2022, is a dueling board game in which you and a rival build up flocks of bird spread over two boards, moving them through Hell to send them boons and ailments.

<h3> Process : </h3>

We started the NYU Global Game Jam 2022 with group ideation, utilizing tools like Google Jamboard to easily conceptualize and share our ideas. We discussed various methods of ideation, and settled on a component based system in which we combined themes and potential mechanics that different members of the group had noted interest in. We then presented to each other on the concepts we had built, and decided on a werewolf themed game that utilized multiple boards and pieces with synchronized movement. Later on in development, the theming was changed to better represent the frantic and chaos inducing mechanics of the game, and it became a game about organizing flocks of birds in Hell. 

<h3> </h3> 

Once we had agreed on the overall concept of Flocking Hell, we started to write the rules. Given the time constraints of the event, we decided to create simplified environments and tokens, instead focusing on fine tuning the unique mechanics and character of the game. As we worked predominantly asynchronously, we utilized various notetaking systems to keep track of potential development issues, one of which was particularly successful for us. After one designer noted the potential Issue, any of us could determine what the Source of the issue may be, how the Effects of the problem might change the gameplay from our intentions, and what sort of Solutions we might have. With this system, we were able to complete production on Flocking Hell, and won **Best Non-Digital Game**.

Going forward, the team looks to create more polished versions of the game's art, and to adjust the game's mechanics based on playtester feedback.
