<h3> </h3>

<h3> Description : </h3>

ResuMaybe is a resume-building tabletop roleplaying game, where you play as either an Interviewer looking to fill a newly opened position, or an Applicant with a randomly filled resume and no knowledge of what the job might be. With only one position up for grabs, it's up to the Interviewer to ask questions that will help them find the right candidate for them, while the Applicants fight to figure out the job and tailor their answers to be awarded with a shiny new job for their resume.
