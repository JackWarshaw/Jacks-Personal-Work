<h1>ResuMaybe</h1>

<img src="docs/assets/images/ResuMaybe Materials.jpg">

<h3> </h3>

<h3> Description : </h3>

ResuMaybe is a resume-building tabletop roleplaying game, where you play as either an Interviewer looking to fill a newly opened position, or an Applicant with a randomly filled resume and no knowledge of what the job might be. With only one position up for grabs, it's up to the Interviewer to ask questions that will help them find the right candidate for them, while the Applicants fight to figure out the job and tailor their answers to be awarded with a shiny new job for their resume.

<h3> Process : </h3> 

We began building ResuMaybe by ideating on its gameplay loop, building out several ways that we could create an interview experience with automatically generated resumes. Our biggest hurdle at this time was the Question phase. While our original idea was to have Interviewers randomly draw cards that would contain questions for the Applicants, we realized this would give players little information on the job they were interviewing for and would potentially not even be relevant to the Interviewer. Instead, we opted for several questions that were developed for each position, with some being shared between positions so more experienced players could not easily determine what the position was. However, the Applicant questions remained universal as to not further challenge the Applicants in determinding the open position. 

<h3> </h3>

Once we finalized the structure of our gameplay loop, we branched out into different disciplines. I, along with other narrative team members, wrote and edited the rules of the game, along with the various prompts, questions, and bios that would come up in play. Others manufactured the cards and playsheets, which were then used in player testing facilitated by yet more members. After rigorous testing, we fine tuned the mechanics and visuals of ResuMaybe, and launched it on itch.io .  

<h3>  </h3>

The team intends to produce further updates to ResuMaybe, adding new jobs, experience, and questions over time.

<h1>Bastion Manor</h1>

<img src="docs/assets/images/Bastion Manor Logo-1.png">

<h3> </h3>

<h3> Description : </h3>

Bastion Manor is a combination puzzle game and podcast series about a haunted house and the people trapped inside it. The player wanders through wreckage brought on by the unfortunate souls who perished to the Manorâ€™s traps, using a podcast recorded by the house and its victims in order to piece together just what happened here and how they might escape.

<h3> The Team : </h3> Joon Lee, James Martini, Raymond Lothian, Kimari Rennis

<h3> My Role : </h3> Game Design, Narrative Design, Writing, Voice Acting (Voice of Bastion Manor), Audio Production, Quality Assurance, Coding  

<h3>  </h3> 

<h3> Process : </h3>
For Bastion Manor, we began with planning the general story of the game and podcast series, as this narrative would then inform not only the scripts for the podcast episodes, but the overall level design within the Manor. I and our other narrative designers then worked on building out the character bios for our potential guests and for our host, after which I worked to modify puzzles built by our other designers to fit the character's themes. 

<h3> </h3>

My duties were then split between resolving bugs we had found during development and producing episodes of the accompanying podcast, acting as a writer, script editor, and voice actor for the latter. One particular hurdle we encountered at this phase was ensuring character consistency across the scripts. Our other writer (Raymond Lothian) and I met on numerous occassions to ensure a consistency of character voice for our show's host, Bastion Manor, and we compiled all our notes and character bios into documentation that allowed for quick reference when writing and recording. While we awaited the designs final puzzle rooms we wrapped production on the podcast episodes for the completed rooms, and I assisted in making the final alterations to the game's code before its release on itch.io. 

<h3> </h3>

Currently, I am working to implement the designs for the final puzzle rooms, and to build a system that natively hosts the podcast episodes in the game itself.

 <h1>Flocking Hell</h1>

<img src="docs/assets/images/Flocking Hell Logo-1.png">

<h3> Description : </h3>

Flocking Hell, awarded **Best Non-Digital Game** at the NYU Global Game Jam 2022, is a dueling board game in which you and a rival build up  flocks of bird spread over two boards, moving them through Hell to send them boons and ailments.  

<h3>  </h3> 

<h3> The Team : </h3> Titus Pahn, KFPlumePal  

<h3>  </h3> 

<h3> My Role : </h3> Game Design, Narrative Design, Writing  

<h3>  </h3> 

<h3> Process : </h3>

We started the NYU Global Game Jam 2022 with group ideation, utilizing tools like Google Jamboard to easily conceptualize and share our ideas. We discussed various methods of ideation, and settled on a component based system in which we combined themes and potential mechanics that different members of the group had noted interest in. We then presented to each other on the concepts we had built, and decided on a werewolf themed game that utilized multiple boards and pieces with synchronized movement. Later on in development, the theming was changed to better represent the frantic and chaos inducing mechanics of the game, and it became a game about organizing flocks of birds in Hell. 

<h3> </h3> 

Once we had agreed on the overall concept of Flocking Hell, we started to write the rules. Given the time constraints of the event, we decided to create simplified environments and tokens, instead focusing on fine tuning the unique mechanics and character of the game. As we worked predominantly asynchronously, we utilized various notetaking systems to keep track of potential development issues, one of which was particularly successful for us. After one designer noted the potential Issue, any of us could determine what the Source of the issue may be, how the Effects of the problem might change the gameplay from our intentions, and what sort of Solutions we might have. With this system, we were able to complete production on Flocking Hell, and won **Best Non-Digital Game**. 

<h3>  </h3> 

Going forward, the team looks to create more polished versions of the game's art, and to adjust the game's mechanics based on playtester feedback.

<h1>.500</h1>

![.500](./docs/assets/images/500_Sample_1.gif)

<h3> Description :</h3> .500 is a 2D platformer built in Unity, and was heavily inspired by the New York City subway system, Lethal League, and Earthbound.  You're late to Interdimensional Baseball practice, and to make matters worse you lost all your gear! Make your way from station to station as you reclaim your equipment, and if you're lucky you might even make it to practice on time.
