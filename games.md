<h3> </h3>

<h3> Description : </h3>

ResuMaybe is a resume-building tabletop roleplaying game, where you play as either an Interviewer looking to fill a newly opened position, or an Applicant with a randomly filled resume and no knowledge of what the job might be. With only one position up for grabs, it's up to the Interviewer to ask questions that will help them find the right candidate for them, while the Applicants fight to figure out the job and tailor their answers to be awarded with a shiny new job for their resume.

<h3> Description :</h3> .500 is a 2D platformer built in Unity, and was heavily inspired by the New York City subway system, Lethal League, and Earthbound.  You're late to Interdimensional Baseball practice, and to make matters worse you lost all your gear! Make your way from station to station as you reclaim your equipment, and if you're lucky you might even make it to practice on time.
