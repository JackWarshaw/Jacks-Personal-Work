<h1>ResuMaybe</h1>

<img src="docs/assets/images/ResuMaybe Materials.jpg">

<h3> </h3>

<h3> Description : </h3>

ResuMaybe is a resume-building tabletop roleplaying game, where you play as either an Interviewer looking to fill a newly opened position, or an Applicant with a randomly filled resume and no knowledge of what the job might be. With only one position up for grabs, it's up to the Interviewer to ask questions that will help them find the right candidate for them, while the Applicants fight to figure out the job and tailor their answers to be awarded with a shiny new job for their resume. 

<h3>  </h3>

<h3> My Role : </h3> Game Design, Narrative Design, Writing  

<h3>  </h3> 

<h3> Process : </h3> 

During the initial production for ResuMaybe, my main task was working alongside the other designers as we developed the initial play pattern. We decided to structure the game in ways that would invoke clear parity to the actual process of searching for a job, invoking touchstones like pre-prepared interview questions. This served as a point of difficulty during development, as we wanted to provide clear guidance for the Interviewer role without Applicants getting the same sets of questions for the same role. 

<h3>  </h3> 

While we initially considered questions that could work for any job role, we instead decided on a list of themed questions and generic questions that the interviewer could select form at random, again reflecting the both highly specific and open ended nature of many actual professional interviews. This also provided another opportunity to heavily theme the game around the interview questions, a challenge which I took on along with several other narrative designers. After iterating through the wide variety of Interviewer Questions and Applicant Attributes, we ended up with the current version of ResuMaybe!

<h3> </h3>

The team intends to produce further updates to ResuMaybe, adding new jobs, experience, and questions over time.

 <h1>Flocking Hell</h1>

<img src="docs/assets/images/Flocking Hell Logo-1.png">

<h3> Description : </h3>

Flocking Hell, awarded **Best Non-Digital Game** at the NYU Global Game Jam 2022, is a dueling board game in which you and a rival build up  flocks of bird spread over two boards, moving them through Hell to send them boons and ailments.  

<h3>  </h3> 

<h3> The Team : </h3> Titus Pahn, KFPlumePal  

<h3>  </h3> 

<h3> My Role : </h3> Game Design, Narrative Design, Writing  

<h3>  </h3> 

<h3> Process : </h3>

During the NYU Global Game Jam (2022), I worked alongside several novice designers to build out Flocking Hell. Though the process of ideation and early development in itself proved fruitful for our team, it also allowed me to test several ideation structures that I had personally developed, including one that I still use in teaching introductory game design students and in my own game making. After running the group through this ideation process and through discussion, roles and responsbilities were assigned to the various group members.  

<h3> </h3> 

Given the time constraints of the event, we decided to create simplified environments and tokens, instead focusing on fine tuning the unique mechanics and narative theming of the game. As we worked predominantly asynchronously, we utilized various notetaking systems (Trello, Jira) to keep track of potential development issues. After developing an initial prototype we submitted Flocking Hell, and won **Best Non-Digital Game**. 

<h3>  </h3> 

Going forward, the team looks to create more polished versions of the game's art, and adjust the game's mechanics based on playtester feedback. 

<h3>  </h3> 

<h3> Status : </h3> Released, Updates Pending

<h1>.500</h1>

![.500](./docs/assets/images/500_Sample_1.gif)

<h3> Description :</h3> .500 is a 2D platformer built in Unity, and was heavily inspired by the New York City subway system, Lethal League, and Earthbound.  You're late to Interdimensional Baseball practice, and to make matters worse you lost all your gear! Make your way from station to station as you reclaim your equipment, and if you're lucky you might even make it to practice on time.

<h1>Cosmic Scale</h1>

![Cosmic Scale](./docs/assets/images/CosmicScale.png)

<h3> Description : </h3> Cosmic Scale is a 2D infinite runner developed in PyGame, primarily for individuals who have issus with motor control. Rather than using a standard controller, players of Cosmic Scale will use the pitch of their voice to move their character, making a normally reflex centered genre accessible to whole new players.

<h1>Bastion Manor</h1>

<img src="docs/assets/images/Bastion Manor Logo-1.png">

<h3> </h3>

<h3> Description : </h3>

Bastion Manor is a combination puzzle game and podcast series about a haunted house and the people trapped inside it. The player wanders through wreckage brought on by the unfortunate souls who perished to the Manorâ€™s traps, using a podcast recorded by the house and its victims in order to piece together just what happened here and how they might escape. 
<h3>  </h3> 

<h3> The Team : </h3> Joon Lee, James Martini, Raymond Lothian, Kimari Rennis

<h3>  </h3> 

<h3> My Role : </h3> Game Design, Narrative Design, Writing, Voice Acting (Voice of Bastion Manor), Audio Production, Quality Assurance

<h3>  </h3> 

<h3> Process : </h3>
For Bastion Manor, we began with planning the general story of the game and podcast series, as this narrative would then inform not only the scripts for the podcast episodes, but the overall level design within the Manor. I and our other narrative designers then worked on building out the character bios for our potential guests and our host, after which I worked to modify puzzles built by our other designers to fit the character's themes. 

<h3> </h3>

My duties were then split between resolving several small technical bugs we had found during development and producing episodes of the accompanying podcast, acting as a writer, script editor, and voice actor for the latter. One particular hurdle we encountered at this phase was ensuring character consistency across the scripts. Our other writer (Raymond Lothian) and I met on numerous occassions to ensure a consistency of character voice for our show's host, Bastion Manor, and we compiled all our notes and character bios into documentation that allowed for quick reference when writing and recording. While we awaited the designs final puzzle rooms we wrapped production on the podcast episodes for the completed rooms, and I assisted in making the final alterations to the game's code before its release on itch.io. 

<h3> </h3>

Currently, the team is working to implement the designs for the final puzzle rooms, resolve some final bugs, and to build a system that natively hosts the podcast episodes within the game itself.
