<h3> Description : </h3>

Bastion Manor is a combination puzzle game and podcast series about a haunted house and the people trapped inside it. The player wanders through wreckage brought on by the unfortunate souls who perished to the Manorâ€™s traps, using a podcast recorded by the house and its victims in order to piece together just what happened here and how they might escape.

<h3>Udacity Classwork</h3>

<h3> Description : </h3> 
This is the work I compiled for my Udacity nanodegree, AI for Healthcare. This includes a Tensorflow based selection system to find the ideal candidates for testing a diabetes drug based on medical files, a segmentation algorithm to ease doctors finding the location and volume of the hippocampus in 3d medical images, and a predictive model for the presence of Pneumonia in x-rays to give greater clinician priority to higher risk patients.
