<h3> Description : </h3>

Bastion Manor is a combination puzzle game and podcast series about a haunted house and the people trapped inside it. The player wanders through wreckage brought on by the unfortunate souls who perished to the Manorâ€™s traps, using a podcast recorded by the house and its victims in order to piece together just what happened here and how they might escape.

![.500](./docs/assets/images/500_Sample_1.gif)

<h3> Description :</h3> .500 is a 2D platformer built in Unity, and was heavily inspired by the New York City subway system, Lethal League, and Earthbound.  You're late to Interdimensional Baseball practice, and to make matters worse you lost all your gear! Make your way from station to station as you reclaim your equipment, and if you're lucky you might even make it to practice on time.

<h3> Description : </h3> Cosmic Scale is a 2D infinite runner developed in PyGame, primarily for individuals who have issus with motor control. Rather than using a standard controller, players of Cosmic Scale will use the pitch of their voice to move their character, making a normally reflex centered genre accessible to whole new players.

<h1>Udacity Classwork</h1>

<h3> Description : </h3> 
This is the work I compiled for my Udacity nanodegree, AI for Healthcare. This includes a Tensorflow based selection system to find the ideal candidates for testing a diabetes drug based on medical files, a segmentation algorithm to ease doctors finding the location and volume of the hippocampus in 3d medical images, and a predictive model for the presence of Pneumonia in x-rays to give greater clinician priority to higher risk patients.
